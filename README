Srcbox - Open-soured sandbox built using Source SDK 2013
A free mod ment to be an open-sourced version of garrys mod, with improvments
Note: This is a Singleplayer Mod. I do not plan a multiplayer version at all

Main features:
  Physgun repaired and code to freeze things (ammo removed)
  PBR Support
  Some L4D/2 Entities not supported by Garry's Mod

Needing to be added:
  Shaders repoints (to fix l4d/2 stuff)
  Lua
  Physgun rotation code
