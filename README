Srcbox - An open-sourced sandbox built using Source SDK 2013 SP
A free mod ment to be an open-sourced version of garrys mod (10), with improvments
Note: This is a Singleplayer Mod. I do not plan a multiplayer version at all (at this point in time)
THIS VERSION OF THE MOD IS NOW INACTIVE!
Im moving to SDK 2013 (2025) with TF2 stuff. Would rather use a updated official sdk with TF2 support and such then old SP branch from 12 years ago.

Main features:
  Physgun repaired and code to freeze things (ammo removed (todo-fix))
  PBR Support
  Some L4D/2 Entities not supported by Garry's Mod

Needing to be added:
  Shaders repoints (to fix l4d/2 stuff) - Somewhat complete as an override. Thanks ficool2!
  Lua
  Physgun rotation code
